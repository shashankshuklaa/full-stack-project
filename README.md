# Full-Stack Task Management Application

A scalable full-stack web application built with React and Node.js/Express, implementing secure JWT-based authentication and a protected dashboard with complete CRUD functionality.

This project demonstrates frontend-backend integration, authentication architecture, RESTful API design, and scalable application structure suitable for production-ready environments.
